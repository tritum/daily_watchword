Introduction
============


What can it do?
===============

The extension can display the watchword of the day from the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine `<http://www.ebu.de>`_.
It shows the current time and two verses from the bible. One from the Old and one from the New Testament.


**example:**

How it works
============

The extension doesn't come with the watchwords it has to import it from a source. To fulfill its purpose, you need to
:ref:`set up <set up>` the scheduler task "Download Watchwords". The default is to download it from the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine `<http://www.losungen.de/download/>`_
but it is possible to :ref:`configure <configure>` the download path to use other or your own watchwords.

Principles
==========

- Based on extbase and fluid

- Abide by TYPO3 coding guidelines

- Unit tested

- Configurable

- Easy to use
