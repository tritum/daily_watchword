TYPO3 Extension daily_watchword
===============================

Version 1.0

The extension displays the watchword of the day from the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine `<http://www.ebu.de>`.
It shows the current date and two verses from the bible. One from the Old and one from the New Testament.

The extension is officially authorized by the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine.

Requirements
------------

- TYPO3 8.7

Installation
------------

1) Simply download the extension from GitHub and upload it to your TYPO3 installation via the extension manager.

2) Create a new scheduler task "Download Watchwords". The extension downloads the watchwords for the current year.
There is no need to run the task on a regular base. It is enough to run it manually once a year. Every time it runs,
it checks if there is a watchword for today in the database and if not, its starts the import process.

Usage
-----

Add a frontend plugin to a page of your choice.
